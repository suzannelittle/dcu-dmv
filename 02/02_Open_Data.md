## Open Data

_Suzanne Little, suzanne.little@dcu.ie_&nbsp;

[Open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) is data that anyone can access, use and share. Governments, businesses and individuals can use open data to bring about social, economic and environmental benefits.

To get an overview of open data, take this introductory module provided by the [European Open Data](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/elearning/en/module1/#/id/co-01). It’s very short\!

The module explores the following questions: 

<!---->
- What is open data?

- What is data?

- What makes data open?

- Why do we need open data?

The [other modules](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/elearning/en/#/id/co-01) in the European Open Data course are very interesting but not necessary to take for this module. Explore them if you are interested in learning more.

Some examples of projects that use open data are:

<!---->
- [Plantwise \- Lose less, feed more](https://www.plantwise.org/) \(https://www.plantwise.org/\)

- [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap](https://www.hotosm.org/) \(https://www.hotosm.org/\)

- [OpenGLAM](https://openglam.org/) \(https://openglam.org/\)

Or even a less elevated topic … the [Great British Public Toilet Map: open geospatial data](https://theodi.org/projects-services/projects/public-service-delivery-case-studies/#1544000471046-5560564e-dea9)\! 

Hopefully you now understand what open data is and how it is provided by companies, governments or other organisations. You’ve seen other examples of open data in the first course when we explored [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) or looked at [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/).
