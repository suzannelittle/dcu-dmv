### DMV: Exploratory Data Visualisations

_Week 1: Introduction_&nbsp;

Complete the background skills survey: [https://forms.gle/iJPBGKYG9kviKhFr5](https://forms.gle/iJPBGKYG9kviKhFr5)

Let’s take a look at how interactive visualisations can help us understand complex concepts. In 2010 a Swedish statistician and economist Hans Rosling presented a popular documentary on the BBC \- The Joy of Stats. This video visualises 200 countries over 200 years using 120,000 numbers in just 4 minutes.

The aim of this activity is to use [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools) to explore interactive data visualisations. 

Before you start, take a look at [this video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/231885967) for a short introduction to the Gapminder interface. 

Now go to the online bubbles charts in [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles) \(we’ll learn more about these later\!\) and start to explore:

Submit your answers to Q1, 4 & 5 using this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/ea5jWT3i4guCxn5Y7) and see what your classmates think.

<!---->
1. Try to change the data attributes on the X & Y\-axis of the graph to see what sort of data is available \(See Figure 1 for an example of this\). Find one that you think is interesting and submit this.

2. What can you discover about the relationship between literacy and life expectancy?

3. Look at the “Trends” option \(click on Bubbles\) and change it to show life expectancy, choosing some countries that interest you \(See Figure 2 below\).

4. In 2018, who has a better life expectancy/income \- Ireland, US or Denmark?

5. Based on the information in Gapminder, would you rather live in Norway, Portugal or Canada? Why?

We’ll look at how visualisation works in much more detail later in the course. A warning that sadly many graphs can be deceiving and misleading. I recommend that you read this [article](https://hbr.org/2015/06/beware-spurious-correlations) published in the Harvard Business Review. Additionally, for fun you can take a look at Tyler Vigen’s [Spurious Correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) and try to find your own spurious correlations using this [tool](https://tylervigen.com/discover).
